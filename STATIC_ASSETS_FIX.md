# üîß **STATIC ASSETS 404 FIX: NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT**

## üö® **Issue Identified**

The site was showing 404 errors for static assets:

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
vendors-f469a2a75e1b81ef.js:1 Failed to load resource
webpack-440b338d41cbfbc9.js:1 Failed to load resource
main-app-6e984608e73c00fb.js:1 Failed to load resource
```

## üîç **Root Cause**

The problem was caused by a **conflicting redirect rule** in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

This redirect was **intercepting all requests**, including static asset requests to `/_next/static/chunks/`, and redirecting them to `/index.html` instead of serving the actual JavaScript files.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

### **Removed Problematic Redirect**

```toml
# ‚ùå REMOVED - This was causing the issue
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### **Let Netlify Plugin Handle Routing**

The `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin automatically generates the correct redirects for Next.js applications. By removing the conflicting redirect, we allow the plugin to:

1. **Serve static assets correctly** from `/_next/static/`
2. **Handle dynamic routes** properly
3. **Generate appropriate redirects** for Next.js routing

### **Final Configuration**

```toml
[build]
  command = "pnpm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18.20.8"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--version"
  NPM_VERSION = "10.8.2"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

# Let the Netlify Next.js plugin handle routing automatically
# The plugin will generate the necessary redirects for Next.js

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Permissions-Policy = "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()"
    Referrer-Policy = "origin-when-cross-origin"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
```

## üéØ **Expected Results**

After this fix, the site should:

1. ‚úÖ **Load static assets correctly** (`/_next/static/chunks/` files)
2. ‚úÖ **Execute JavaScript without MIME type errors**
3. ‚úÖ **Display the full website functionality**
4. ‚úÖ **Handle all routes properly**

## üîç **Verification Steps**

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - No more 404 errors for static assets
   - No more MIME type errors
   - JavaScript executes properly

2. **Test Site Functionality**
   - Homepage loads completely
   - Navigation works
   - All pages render correctly
   - No broken functionality

3. **Monitor Netlify Dashboard**
   - Build completes successfully
   - No deployment errors
   - Static assets are served correctly

## üìö **Technical Details**

### **Why This Happened**

- The `/*` redirect was too broad and caught all requests
- Next.js static assets need to be served directly, not redirected
- The Netlify plugin handles Next.js routing automatically

### **Best Practices**

- **Never use broad redirects** (`/*`) with Next.js on Netlify
- **Let the Netlify plugin handle routing** for Next.js applications
- **Only add specific redirects** when absolutely necessary
- **Test static asset loading** after configuration changes

---

## üéâ **Status: RESOLVED**

**The static assets 404 issue has been fixed by removing the conflicting redirect rule and allowing the Netlify Next.js plugin to handle routing automatically.**

**Next Steps**: Monitor the new deployment to confirm all static assets load correctly.
