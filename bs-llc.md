## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Feature-Flag System

- Central config (`features.config.ts`) enables/disables business verticals (mining, forestry, etc.).
- Disabling a feature removes its UI, API, and admin controls, allowing for agile business scaling.
- Feature modules are self-contained: UI, logic, Supabase rules, and tests are co-located.

### 3.2 Supabase Integration

- **PostgreSQL**: All dynamic data (projects, service requests, users, content) stored in Supabase tables.
- **Supabase Auth**: Email/password, phone, and social logins for clients, partners, and staff.
- **Supabase Storage**: Media uploads (project photos, compliance docs, product images).
- **Edge Functions**: Business logic for logistics notifications, report generation, and secure operations.
- **RLS (Row Level Security)**: Strict database rules enforce data access policies (e.g., a client can only see their own transport data).
- **Realtime**: Live updates for fleet tracking, project status, and notifications.

## 5. Core Features & Capabilities

### 5.1 Multi-Language Support

Built-in support for English and French:

```typescript
// /src/config/i18n.config.ts
export const SUPPORTED_LOCALES = [
  'en',    // English
  'fr',    // French
] as const;

export const DEFAULT_LOCALE = 'en';
```

### 5.2 Authentication & Authorization

Role-based access tailored to business operations:

```typescript
// /src/lib/auth.ts
export const AUTH_ROLES = {
  SUPER_ADMIN: 'super_admin',
  ADMIN: 'admin',          // Manages a specific business vertical
  PROJECT_MANAGER: 'project_manager',
  LOGISTICS_COORDINATOR: 'logistics_coordinator',
  CLIENT: 'client',
  PARTNER: 'partner'
} as const;

export const PERMISSIONS = {
  // Project Management
  PROJECT_CREATE: 'project:create',
  PROJECT_UPDATE: 'project:update',
  PROJECT_DELETE: 'project:delete',
  
  // Logistics Management
  LOGISTICS_VIEW_ALL: 'logistics:view_all',
  LOGISTICS_UPDATE_STATUS: 'logistics:update_status',
  
  // Content Management
  CONTENT_PUBLISH: 'content:publish',
  
  // System Administration
  SYSTEM_SETTINGS: 'system:settings'
} as const;
```

---

## 6. Security Implementation

The security architecture remains robust, covering CSP, rate limiting, validation, and authentication policies as defined in the original documentation. All security measures will be applied across the new service and project features.

```typescript
// /src/lib/security.ts
export const SECURITY_CONFIG = {
  // Content Security Policy
  csp: {
    'default-src': ["'self'"],
    'script-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    'style-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    'img-src': ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:'],
    'font-src': ["'self'", 'https://fonts.gstatic.com'],
    'connect-src': ["'self'", 'https://*.supabase.co']
  },
  
  // Rate Limiting, Input Validation, and Auth policies remain as before.
  // ...
};
```

---

## 7. Performance Optimization

Performance strategies, including image optimization, caching, code splitting, and network resilience, are critical for serving communities in Cameroon and will be implemented as previously outlined.

---

## 8. Netlify Configuration

The `netlify.toml` configuration remains optimal for a Next.js and Supabase project, providing edge handling, security headers, and caching policies.
